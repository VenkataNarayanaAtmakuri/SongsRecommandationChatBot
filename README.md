# Aura - AI Song Recommendation Chatbot

A full-stack AI chatbot named Aura, built with a Python (Flask) backend and a modern "glassmorphism" UI. Uses Google Gemini for natural language intent classification to provide weather (OpenWeatherMap) and song recommendations (Spotify).

## ‚ú® Core Features

  * **Natural Language Understanding:** Aura uses Google Gemini to understand *what* a user means, not just what they type. It can differentiate between a general chat, a request for weather, and a request for music.
  * **AI-Driven Conversation:** The bot can hold natural conversations, answer general knowledge questions, and remember the chat history to handle follow-up questions.
  * **Real-Time Weather:** Connects to the **OpenWeatherMap API** to fetch and display current weather data for any city.
  * **Music Recommendations:** Connects to the **Spotify API** to provide song recommendations based on mood, genre, or artist.
  * **Personalized Creator Info:** The bot is programmed to know who its creator is and can provide your professional portfolio and LinkedIn links when asked.
  * **Polished UI/UX:**
      * A full-screen, responsive "frosted glass" (glassmorphism) UI.
      * An animated gradient background.
      * A dynamic welcome screen with clickable example prompts.
      * A "Clear Chat" confirmation modal to prevent accidental deletion.
  * **Markdown Rendering:** Bot responses are correctly parsed from markdown to display **bold text**, lists, and clean HTML links.
